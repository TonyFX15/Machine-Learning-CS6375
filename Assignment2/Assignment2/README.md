I want to use one free day for this project


The data I used is iris dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

To run the code, download the iris data from the link, 
transform it to a csv file

Run the NN.py file using python 3.6 and above
The results of the test error will display as the output.
