Tweets Clustering using k-means
Objectives:
 Compute the similarity between tweets using the Jaccard Distance metric.
 Cluster tweets using the K-means clustering algorith

the numebr of clusters are set to 25 as deafault
 To complie the code, type
 python Tweets_K_mean.py 25 InitialSeeds.txt Tweets.json output.txt

 the SSE after calculation is around 9.3
 The reuslts are writing into the output.txt file
